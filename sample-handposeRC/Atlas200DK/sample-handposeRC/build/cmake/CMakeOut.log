CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/ascend/Documents/handposerc/sample-handposeRC/Atlas200DK/sample-handposeRC/build/cmake/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/ascend/AscendProjects/sample-handposeRC/build/cmake where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/ascend/Documents/handposerc/sample-handposeRC/Atlas200DK/sample-handposeRC/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/ascend/AscendProjects/sample-handposeRC/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
