This project showcases the Atlas200DK board used for controlling an RC car with hand gestures.<br />
Demo video: [demo]


## Project overview

This project consists of two parts:
-   Atlas200DK application
-   Peripherial devices (Arduino, RC car, etc)



<br />**The Atlas200DK application can be deployed on its own. The program will run even if the peripherial devices are not connected.** In this case, hand keypoints and the control command are displayed in real time as shown in the demo video.<br /><br />
Connecting the peripherial devices will allow the RC car to follow the control commands.



### Deployment steps
The first step is to set up the Atlas200DK board and run the application.
